## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you'd like to discuss a potential feature request, you can open an issue or reach out to our open-source team via **open-source@ukfast.co.uk** who will get back to you as soon as possible.

If you think you have identified a security vulnerability, please contact our team via **security@ukfast.co.uk** instead of using the issue tracker.
